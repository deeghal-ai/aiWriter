<planning_rules>
1. story_angle: One sentence capturing the central tension - make it punchy and specific
2. hook_strategy: CHOOSE the BEST strategy for THIS specific comparison:
   - "WhatsApp Debate": When opinions are genuinely divided, conflict-driven
   - "Unexpected Truth": When you have a contrarian insight that challenges assumptions
   - "Specific Scenario": When a vivid moment captures the comparison perfectly
   - "Price Paradox": When the value story is counterintuitive
   Suggestion: "${hookRecommendation.strategy}" - but pick what fits the DATA best
3. hook_elements: Specific, not generic. Use Indian cities, real scenarios, actual prices
4. truth_bomb: Single most surprising insight from data - must be data-backed and unexpected
5. quote_allocation: Assign quote numbers (Q1, Q2...) to sections. Max 20 total, 2-3 per section
6. tension_points: 3-4 trade-offs that create reader tension
7. matrix_focus_areas: Top 5 comparison dimensions based on persona priorities - SPECIFIC not generic
8. contrarian_angle: Why someone might HATE the winner - make it real
9. closing_insight: Unexpected truth to end with (quotable, memorable)
10. callbacks: Elements to reference across sections for cohesion
