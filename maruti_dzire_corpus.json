Good on Maruti, and kudos to their engineers!",

        "transcript": "there has never really been a goodlooking desire until now it's bold it's Stu it's unexpected it is a what the actual moment from Marti Suzuki gone are the curves sharpness is in gone is the ungainliness proportions are in G is the familiarity fr freshness is in gone is that stuck on boot design thoughtfulness is in gone are the small wheels nope those are still here and they look [Music] uh there are however some really standout bits the head lamps and tail lamps for example and proper premium looking LED headlights not the project ctor with an LED H4 bulb that we've become so used to and that means much much more premium Audi style design language nice tail lamps too quite thoughtfully design and by the way this spoiler that isn't an option it's standard on all variants overall then this is the best desire to ever come out the maruti Suzuki stable in fact is this the best looking compact sedan ever [Music] made and that's where the shock in or ends and this inside feels as familiar as this old school hip-hop [Music] beat traditional dials that are really clear a climate control module from the Swift and a large screen that has most gizmos that you would need like for example a 360° camera and all the beige and fake wood trim in the world all thrown into here because as nice and flashy and modern looking an exterior that this desire buyer wants on the inside all they want is something safe simple and beige and beige and beige more beige but if it works it works the Swift is for enthusiasts the desire isn't the desire is for middle-aged people who want a car to drive from A to B it is a car for the smaller town man or woman who can finally afford to upgrade from the Alo or a vagar we might not shower this car with the same love and affection as we do to Enthusiast vehicles but remember for some people this car will be the lifetime achievement of a dream a strive to do better or strive to tell your neighbors around you that you've bought a car with a boot with a Dicky and that is why this simple safe Almost Boring will sell thousands and thousands and thousands every single month sometimes simple safe and boring works but that isn't the car's only Mission this will be a people carrier a child carrier a Chau for limousine and let's face it it will also be an Uber at some point in its life and that that is why what happens in this seat is as important as what happens in that one now look I am 5'1 with my shoes on and that means I'm about average Indian height or a little over average Indian height and that is a bit of an issue because if I sit upright like as if I've been punished by the principal then my head touches this roof panel up here but if I sit slightly more comfortable slightly more slouch down then I have about half an inch or 1 inch of head space and my feet aren't faal to the back of the front seat like it used to be in previous generations of the desire and it's got a comfortable handrest as well oh and I forgot it's got a sunroof by desire my sunroof [Music] be we interrupt this program to bring you a special report this is a public service announcement if you buy this car please do not put your body out of the sunroof as it can lead to your head being decapitated or death or worse [Applause] now I know exactly what all the comments are going to say about this car oh three cylinder engine one less than the last one now look we've been driving this Swift for the last few months and so I have some people whose Automotive opinions I value greatly and all of us single-handedly agree that this engine is fun fine it is low on horsepower as compared to the last one but it is still fun it's got a soul yes it is a little noisier than the 4-cylinder engine and a little less smooth like with most three-cylinder engines like that awesome K10 3-cylinder engine which by the way I own and that has a soul too but none of that matters to a desired driver because all that matters are two figures low maintenance costs and High fuel economy we aren't going to do a 0 to 100 run we aren't going to do an 80 to 120 run and I'm not going to tell you how this engine comes alive at certain speeds oh wait I just did but the desire driver does not care because for him the fuel economy figure is more important than everything 25.7 one for the automatic 24.79% when there's a CNG version that comes in some people are going to be even more happy more happy than getting 20 more horsepower in fact and look if a car gives happiness in a different form in any form then it's doing its job it's got all the typical maruti desire traits too it has relative comfort of course it handles really well and it is really light to use in terms of steering feedback it it's just one of those trouble-free tension free non nonsense cars yeah and I think as humans we need that in our [Music] life you think we forgot about safety nope we kept the best for last now when I drove the car there was no safety rating announced for it so I did a whole monologue on how maroti needs to get off their ass and really start making cars safer because the Indian public just won't take it anymore I also conveyed the exact same view and frankly frustration to the engineering team that I met after my drive and they smile like they were hiding something little did we know that that little secret would be maruti's first ever Five star rated car this is a big deal folks maruti is finally getting its act together and making an effort to make cars safer than the government set norms and mandates and this effects every single one of us because even if we don't buy it as one of our personal cars we will find ourselves in the bag of an Uber and thus a safer car is always a better car period there have also been a lot of comments about how the test is rigged and how the tested car is in the Indian spec frankly both of these allegations are hilarious to see play out as the exact same test scenarios were also applicable to say Mahindra or Tata or Volkswagen so credit where it is due folks credit where it is due and now that maruti has got the ball rolling we do expect a lot more from them whatever we say here really doesn't matter this car will sell you will see them everywhere you will see them modified in weird ways with chrome bits you will see them really cleanly kept you will see them in battered State you will see them with yellow number plates basically 6 months from now this will be ubiquitous this time you will see it once you will probably stop and see it again and go [Music] nice okay time for the unscripted section and because you guys love this so much we're going to continue doing this on all our first drives and reviews and stuff like that that lack of handrest is another problem uh I mean yeah we can put stuff in the middle ear when we shoot uh but otherwise a lack of a general handrest especially on the automatic versions is genuinely a big issue and yes there aftermarket options for that but sometimes aftermarket isn't as good as OEM uh boot opening is another big issue now normally on the Swift or the Baleno if you use the unlock button on the door panel here the boot unlocks as well in this you have to use the key or you have to bend down which is a problem for people like me bend down all the way here bottom reach down and pull a lever which opens the boat why like it's absolutely pointless I know you can do it from the key for but yet small wheels now we've made a little comment in the middle of the review but I want to talk about this again um a car like this even the Swift for that matter 15 in on the top spec just doesn't cut it anymore it just looks so imbalanced it looks so out of place just put a slightly larger wheel a 16-in wheel and it makes a world of a difference in terms of the way it looks I mean come on you have to move on eventually to a larger wheel and tire diameter this is the time to do it maruti be brave and give us a 16-in wheel and tire I know that there's 15-inch Market because of cabs and cheaper wheels and Tes 14 and 15 but at least give an option to people to put a 16 on it like a ZXI optional Plus Pack or something to that let's have an oem option right and then finally panel gaps now I mentioned on the Swift Bonnet that there's a weird panel Gap this there's a weird panel gap on the boot in this as well we put a little cutaway of it but uh We've also noticed on some of the cars panel gaps aren't really great uh there're sort of different on the say top seam and then it get gets a little larger or smaller as the seam goes lower or the gaps go lower so there are some the sort of discrepancies and that's not something that maruti usually does normally panel gaps although there are big panel gaps are normally equal in this case we've seen some variations of panel Gap so that's something that maruti maybe needs to have another look at apart from that the desire is a desire it's going to be simple it's going to be typically desire is and it's just going to work for miles and miles and kilometers and kilometers and do millions of kilometers without ever breaking down as long as you do oil changes and plug changes and general servicing right so there you have it that's our video on the new desire tell us in the comment section how you like the car in general tell us what you thought about the unscripted section as always be respectful in the comments I will respond to every single comment if possible and if not we'll definitely respond from the power Channel directly okay see you all folks uh and see you in the comments below [Music]",

        "transcript": "[Music] welcome everybody to a brand new quickies on the power dri YouTube channel today we've got with us the new desire now this is something that's actually rather interesting because okay first and foremost I can't give my opinion on anything so far because there an embargo on the opinion but I can tell you facts and figures and stuff like that right so let me quickly tell you more about the G now obviously the car is very very different looking from what the Swift is because um although it sort of shares the same platform all body panels are completely different now this is factual right because um this is different the front end is different the bonnet's different the a pillar is different the roof lines different the doors are different every single piece of bodyw work on this car is different from what the Swift is now that is important because the last two generations of the Swift desire last three generations have been essentially a Swift with an extended boot on it this is not that uh it's a purpose-built sedan four sub4 meter sedan that was built from scratch by the design team at maruti Suzuki in India nonetheless and their brief was very very simple let's make the desire I think look good and that's exactly what they have well have they done it have they not that's my opinion that I can't give you but you can tell me in the comments if this is a good-looking desire finally a good-looking desire now let's talk about some of the features in the front a lot more angular than what the desire has ever been now obviously the older Swifts were never angular as such that's why the desire was not angular this one is now this has again got no no stay in the front stay in the front let me show you what it has so it's got LED headlamps but but they are LED headlamps with like a little section of LED in them so stuff that you see on a lot more premium cars smaller sections of LEDs not like a LED projector lamp which we are used to seeing on maruti cars like the Swift or the balenos that's a bit of a upgrade in my opinion but again it's not an opinion it is an upgrade because visible and you've got also more sort of U large and diagonal and very very sharp looking front end nice uh I can't say if they're nice or not but again 15-in wheels on this would I have liked a larger set maybe I would but again I can't really give my opinion because it is embargo so I can't tell you what I really think of it but you can sort of make out but again Wheels H now the big thing with desire has always been this part right this was never really flown in nicely this time around look at it it it's well structured that's again a fact and again this sort of line that sweeps in from the roof to the boot isn't abrupt again that's a fact this spoiler is also standard on every single model um it is because they didn't want to have like a first gen desire style uh fall off on the Bonnet on the boot so they have this spoiler standard and they've got LED tail lights here now again this is something that uh personally I'm a bit of a fan of this sort of toffee or raval along like um Style lighting structure and you've got yellow headlight sorry number blade bulbs maybe a white one would have looked slightly nicer but this is what it is overall at the back though it is very flat read between the lines very very flat and also it has a nice size boot let me see if we can pop it open let me actually unlock it there we go oh I wasn't holding it properly my bad so large boot we can uh fit maybe most of me in it quite large right okay enough faffing around people actually seem to like it because people are looking at it quite often so right so again as you mentioned oh by the way the dog just speed on the car doggy look even the dog likes it that's not my opinion that's the dog's opinion you like the desire okay let's talk more about the car though so right as I mentioned the roof line again the roof is completely different from the Swift which is why this is completely different and it's sort of was well it's a Well packaged car it's a nice looking car to be honest I'm going to give a little bit of opinion but look that's what it is right okay let's move to the inside and see what's new on the inside okay I'm again very sorry about the lack of light but we need to do this in a bit of a hurry to bring this video out to you at the time it actually does go out so it's beeping away to Glory because the light and the door is on and the doors open anyways uh similar style dashboard to what you get on the Swift so you get this nice nice sort of instrument cluster here AC instrument cluster here with all the climate control options and manual climate control or sort of switches for the climate control which is good big touchscreen you also get a sort of very very Crystal Clear instrument cluster which is very similar to what the Swift has as well no real changes in the interior design but the big change in the interior is actually the materials used or are the materials used now as compared to the Swift which gets like a more spottier look this gets a fake wood finish this gets silver on the top and it gets beige on the top here and obviously beige Interiors like every single desire has had in the past and will probably continue to have because this sort of segment really really wants their beige also this car gets a sunroof which of course is first in any desire ever desire has never had a sunroof so now you can have a sunroof on your desire if you really want it's not very big so probably people won't fit through it which is a good thing but otherwise uh yeah I mean you get a sunroof on the desire I mean otherwise it's pretty much Swift as exactly as it is this one is a manual uh there's an automatic option as well uh but it's plain simple it's exactly what you need from the car like this it's it's got features in it of course there's no ad in it but it has everything else that you really need also on a Miss is the um U sort of uh what do you call it heads up display that you get on the Baleno but that this car doesn't have it neither there a swift so this car doesn't have it either okay let's move the back because this is my driving position right now exactly how I drive so let's move to the back and see if there's any space in the back but first I need to move my bag from there okay I'm going to move my bag quickly in the front there we go close this up put the handr down and as you can see lots of space again this is not an opinion this is fact lots of space and probably one of the more comfortable seats in the back in this sort of segment as well I'm not comparing it to anything else no comparisons made here I'm just saying this is a comfortable place to be so much leg room look there's about if I sit normally right with the sort of headrest up there's a bit of a lack of head space honestly because this little structure is exactly where my head is this structure here this sort of top of the roof here is exactly where my head is so this sort of hurts a little bit when you sit but you might have to scoot down even if you scoot down a little bit there is still about 3 or 4 inches of space for my legs in my driving position so that's a good thing of course you have rear AC winds here which can cool your nuts and your knees and you've got dual USB charging points one is a USBC and one is a USB a that's about it that's the new desire for you um tell me in the comments what do you think and I know this is really pathetic light to do this quickies in but we need to get this video out ASAP so there it is new desire for all of you there is a follow-up video coming the next day if you see this when we upload it the next day there's a followup video or if you're on the YouTube channel go look at the followup video which is be going to be longer a little more detailed but again you can't really Give opinions but there will be one so have a look at that as well for now I'm signing off tell me in the comments what you think of the new desire I think it is I can't tell you",

        "transcript": "[Music] yes this is another video on the marudi Suzuki desire this is another quickies video now if you've already seen the first video that we put out which has absolutely pathetic lighting I just want to tell you that our flight got delayed and we got stuck in traffic for two and a half hours and we literally only got the car for about a half an hour so we brought you what we could but as I promised in that video we'll do another video so this is that other video this is of course the car now out in the open out in the daylight and again I'm going to take you through the car just generally take you to the car uh quickly without giving you my opinion now um as youve already seen the car yesterday the car looks much sharper than what any desire has ever been and unlike any desire in the past this is not really based on the Swift's body panels either so every single panel that you see the Bonnet the front fender the bumpers even the roof line even the a pillar this all of this the roof itself and of course the rear end is completely bespoke to the desire so that's completely different from every other desire in the past this of course the fourth generation of the desire and uh let's I think come to the front and have a quick sort of more in-depth look at the grill because again as I mentioned much sharper everything is very very sharp everything is very angular and that's of course um because of the fact that the Amaze looks at when the amaz is something that does really well not as much as a desire in terms of sales but I think the desire has progressed to a much nicer looking car now that is of course an opinion but it's also general fact it is a nicer looking car now uh we'll talk about the LED headlamps in just a bit because I'm going to go inside and turn them on and show you what they do come to the side profile for a little bit and let's just talk about the wheels now these are 185 65 R15 exactly the same wheel size and tire from the Swift but not the same design so it's a little more little more modern looking little more uh richer looking if you call it that a little less spoty also and then of course You' got a sunroof which we'll talk about again when we get in the car but again this is the first desire that ever has a sunroof and also the first time the segment has had a sunroof in general now let's talk about this section because this of course is what the desire in the past has all been about till here this was a swift always and then of course a boot was added in this time around much smoother angle to the uh cillar and this whole section looks like it's more naturally integrated in again as I mentioned this was designed from scratch as a subform meter sedan not as a Swift first and then a sedan and this was designed in India so the design team in India has actually done a bunch of stuff on this car to make it look as it is there are a couple of people who say that the rear is U try not to give an opinion but the rear is what it is and yeah you can put some accessories on it we'll probably put some pictures of accessorized car you can put a little accessory on this section here to make it a little busier that's all I'm going to say uh this spoiler comes standard on all variants and it's body colored or body painted so that's also a good thing it's a separate piece they actually wanted to make it the same piece but they made it a separate piece because molding this sort of complex curve is very very difficult so to make things easier for their stamping processes they made this separate uh piece for a spoiler now since we at the back let me just quickly show you the boot now the boot can't be accessed like the Swift or the Baleno just by pressing the unlock button there is a separate lever or you can do it from your uh key fob as well but the boot in general again is quite large we've got all our stuff in it currently but as you can see this big bag I'm just want to pull it out this size bag goes in nice and smoothly there's still a lot of place to sort of play around with of course you can put backpacks you can put large bags in here for sure this still has a bit of a uh a big um what do you call it Big bracket so it does sort of intrude a little bit into space when it goes down but honestly large enough Boot and when this has a CNG tank which sort of goes here you'll still have a decent size boot to contain withd right so that's the exterior of the Swift desire let's quickly go in the front sorry not the Swift desire just the desire cuz from the last generation was called only desire let me move the camera up front and show the LED headlights because unlike what uh maruti's LED headlights in the past have been projectors and then LED bulbs this one is slightly different right so we're going to just turn the car on just a little bit and uh that's the standard DRL mode and then this of course is the headlight and the fog lamp is also on and off right now you can turn it on and off also LED and then you've got the high beam also as an LED unit now as I as you can actually see right that's the welcome message as you can actually see there six individual LED units inside the headlamp so it's not like one big projector that's doing all the work couple of them are for the low beam couple of them are for the high beam and it's all very neatly integrated this led daytime running light and this chrome piece sort of line up and in the aftermarket all of this is going to go into a light bar I am dead sure 100% this panel will be changed immediately from people at cor buug and you'll get a nice light bar running across the car for sure okay so that's the exterior done let's move on to the interior and when we go to the interior we'll also talk about the specs of the car A lot of people do want to know that okay so we've seen this interior before on the Swift of course there are big changes that we'll talk about but generally in terms of design language it's all very very simplistic it's all exctly where you expect it to be so you've got these analog dials with a little this instrument display in the center which is digital which we can't really see right now yeah now you go uh so very very clear very crisp looking dials in general and of course you've got the maroti steering wheel with the controls on it which we've seen over the last few years obviously start and stop and the little uh remote you get so the blue obviously denotes mild hybrid which you have like a start stop system in this as well but in general it's very very simple you've got a little uh cluster here for your climate control and you've got the screen for your infotainment this actually is a really nice screen they do it really well nice and crisp uh user interface as well not super complex as some cars do in this you get of course all the four wood so it's like this almost bronish tint light wood almost like a Driftwood bamboo is wood uh finish and then of course you got beige everywhere now a lot of people have said that black would be preferred and I agree I like black Interiors more than beige Interiors but you have to real this segment of people love beige Interiors they're more conventional segment they're more uh sort of traditional segment and for that traditional segment the beige interior actually works really really well now you don't have leather seats obviously that's something you can put as an aftermarket thought uh um you know at a dealer or maybe aftermarket completely you get cloth seats and they're very very basic they're very simple nothing complex at all you get a sunroof now again as I mentioned first in class in this category never been done before in a compact s and never been done in a desire either okay now the rear seat is actually really really important in the desire for two reasons one a lot of people are going to buy these as chff for driven cars or some sort of driver driving it or people in the backseat are actually going to be given importance because your parents will be in the back or your children Etc and of course let's not discount the fact that these are going to be eventually making their way into a taxy segment so you and I people who take ERS and Olas are going to actually spend a fair bit of time in the rear seat so rear seat which is comfortable is actually important thing for this car now if I sit completely upright it's a bit of an issue because my head does touch the sort of this little bar on the roof so there is a little bit of a scooped out area but this little section here the end of the roof liner actually does hit my head right here but if I sit a little more Comfort comfortably in a little more laidback fashion little scooted down then it doesn't really touch then you've got a bit of a little wiggle room on the top but again I'm 5 10 and a half so anybody taller than me will have a slight issue but even if I do sit in a slightly more slouch fashion in the past my legs would have been touching the steering sort of the front seats and this seat is in my driving position so it's a little bit behind and you still have a lot of space left over or sort of wiggle your knees around with now you of course you have a fold down Center armrest you have a rear AC went as I mentioned it cools your knees and also cools your nuts and you've got two USB slots so you've got a USB a and a USB C sorry USBC and usba Slot right here also you've got a little storage area in the back of the passenger seat but none in the back of the driver seat that is a little weird they should have had one here as well otherwise pretty basic in the back again everything is beige everything is light colored I like these sort of textured side panels in the front as well but overall nothing really to talk about in terms of like crazy features here it's simple it's plain it does exactly what it's supposed to to do that's what the desire is okay let's talk about the specs on the gun okay so a lot of people are going to hate this fact but the desire also comes with the same three cylinder engine that the new Swift actually comes with so let's actually where's the rod gone there it is let's put this down and quickly talk about what this engine is now as I mentioned three cylinder so yes it is slightly noisier it is slightly gruffer rougher but when you actually do get to use it and drive it you really start to like it and that's exactly what's happened when we've been using the Swift for the last few months now the normal Swift and actually I do enjoy this engine quite a lot it's not got outright horsepower like the turbo one lit in the Fran does but it's a fun engine it's got It's got so okay so 82 horsepower 112 Newton M and I actually have the fuel economy figures right here in my pocket so let me read them out the automatic is 25.71% remember those figures are probably the most important figures that any desire owner actually wants and at 920 930 kilos the car is also quite light so overall this should be a very fuel economical car especially when the CG version comes around in a few months so there you have it a more detailed video in proper lighting this time around we apologize for the last video it was done in a bit of a rush manner but you guys did watch it and a lot of people did comment on it but now you can watch it in a little more more clarity the car looks obviously much better in the daytime so tell me what do you think of the new desire do you really like it do you sort of uh does it grow on you in general what do you think right tell me in the comment section below as usual we'll read and we'll reply to everything cool see you guys this has been quickies slightly long but nonetheless new design",

        "transcript": "[Music] this is the all new maruti Suzuki desire it's in its fourth generation now and as you can see it has been completely revamped looks nothing like the Swift but it does share a lot with it the engine the gearbox a lot of the Interior but it does get some exclusive desire bits and today we have it in beautiful Goa to see what it's like out on the road [Music] [Applause] [Music] now the looks obviously the talking point on the desire gone is the bulbous curvy look of the Swift and in place you have a Sleek angular look for the desire it starts off with these horizontal LED headlamps that get some intricate detailing on the inside as well you have this horizontal LED DRL and that gives it the look of a wider car what also helps is the grill that is again nice and wide and these horizont Al slats definitely do the job bumpers are nice and sporty lots of cuts and angles so it looks the part and you have fog lamps housed in between now even though it looks like a wider car dimensionally it still is just as wide as the Swift no over to the side it's a subo meter so 3995 mm of length but you also have 2 450 mm of wheelbase which is the same as the Swift so no real Improvement in leg room at least on paper you have 163 mm of ground clearance 15in alloy wheels with the same size of tire as the Swift but the design for the wheels is nice and new what I also like on the desire is the fact that this part right here because it's not a Swift with a boot anymore they've been able to redesign it and fit in well for the desire and that will also mean better room on the inside now at the rear you have these contemporary looking tail lamps you get a triar DRL inside as well and a lot of detailing so it really goes to show the attention to detail maruti has put in this you of course get some Chrome to satisfy the bling you have a nice duct tail spoiler as well and of course because it's a desire boot space is important 382 L which is 100 L more than the Swift while it is over 100 L more than the Swift with a spare steel wheel under the floor it is in fact the smallest boot in the segment the tigor aura and Amaze all have boots measuring over 400 l [Music] now even though the exterior doesn't resemble the Swift on the inside is where you see a lot of part sharing the steering wheel for one is lifted off you have this power window switch gear as well the dashboard layout is pretty much the same as well but for the desire it's all new you have a new 9-in touchscreen a smart play Pro Plus system Wireless Apple carplay Android auto part of the package Suzuki connect is built in there as well but on this you also get a tire pressure monitoring system and a 360° camera what's also nice is the inclusion of a a wireless charger you have a USB a port up front two cup holders and a 12vt charging socket the new bit on the desire of course is the sunroof now it's not the biggest units but it does the job brings a lot of light and air and speaking of light you have this light upal tree that really uplifts the cabin gives it a nice Airy look and you also see the same treatment on the dashboard it's a dual tone layout which breaks the floor doesn't look monolithic and that's nice you have some fake wood sandwich between the two as well so definitely gives it that sedan look a bit of opulence and that's always welcome seats are nice and comfy cushioning is very nice you have a good amount of support as well you also have USB charging here a USB a port and a type-c port with some space to keep your phone the instrument cluster is similar to the Swift with the analog dials but on the desire you get a chrome ring around the speedometer as well unlike the Swift which only gets it for the ref counter that's the front let's quickly see what all is new at the rear now in the back seat of the all new desire because there has no change to the wheelbase space is not too different from the Swift knee room is just about enough and the back seat is good enough for two passengers there are three-point seat belts for three passengers but only headrest for two so three in the back will be a bit of a squeeze you have AC vents in the back and the two ports can also be used by rear passengers as well what's nice on the Des is that this roof has been scooped out slightly however if you're over 6 ft your hair will still end up brushing here the back rest is at a decent angle as well and you get a center armrest with two cup holders so overall comfortable but if you're over 6 ft it's not going to be enough for you strangely there's a single seat pocket behind the passenger seat with no room behind the driver's seat the interior overall does seem to be larger and not cocon like the dark interior of the Swift courtesy the bright upholster and bright colored panels all around [Music] the new desire was also crash tested by global encap and has scored a perfect five-star rating for adult occupant protection and four stars for child occupant protection making it the first maruti to get a five-star GN cap safety rating the tests include a frontal offset crash test done at 64 kph a side barrier test done at 50 kph a side pole test and a pedestrian safety test as well clearly maruti has done a lot to distinguish the desire from the Swift but when it comes to the powertrain they both are in the same [Music] boat and that means it gets the same 1.2 L 3-cylinder Z2 e engine 82 horsepower 112 n m and made it to a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed AMT now the latter is what we have first AMT gearboxes never really smooth not the best experience but if anyone does AMD is better it is maruti and this is the most refined version they have so if you drive it in a sedate manner it's going to be no problems at all in the city and in traffic it is definitely appreciated because you have a lot of stress taken off your left foot what's also nice on this AMT is the responsiveness of the downshifting if the car is at fifth gear cruising around 60 70 kph if you push if you see an opportunity to overtake just a little legs and it drops down to third or even second in some cases and gives you that much needed talk that is what helps you gain those quick overtakes the engine is refined initially but ring it to the red line and you'll hear a lot more of that Co three-cylinder Ness past the 4,000 RPM now the AMT gearbox also gets a manual mode all you need to do is just slot the gear in m and then take a bit more control it's not the most responsive but with a bit of patience you can definitely get a bit more engagement out of it that said inde D it is nice and relaxed and what complements the gearbox of course is the engine now we've seen the engine on the Swift and of course it's lost that swiftness of the older gen but it still is nice and linear you know you don't really feel like it's a lethargic engine it doesn't have that pep in the second half of the Rev range but from the bottom end it is nice and responsive and that is where you really appreciate it in City driving in that 20 to 40 20 to 60 area that is when the engine has a good amount of Pep to it while the needle does REV freely to the red line performance is gradual and you get a sense that this is not an engine you want to push especially with an AMT but we also sampled the manual to see if that helps the is for [Applause] [Music] enthusiasts now the manual gearbox on the Swift desire nice light clutch and quite Progressive as well but if you're expecting this car to be fun to drive because it's a manual that's really not the case because the engine like I mentioned is quite linear power delivery is gradual so you never really get that oomph you expect and it's not a fun experience of course you have a a bit better control over the power because the gearbox is not trying to upshift as soon as possible like the AMT shifts are nice and light as well the gears slot in very easily and even in traffic it's not going to be too much of a pain because the clutch as I mentioned is very light but with the manual gearbox is where you feel a bit of that lack in power a bit more power would have definitely transform this whole car in terms of the tune both the Swift and the desire share the same gearing and and engine mapping as well what's changed slightly is the suspension tune to compensate for the added weight for the desire ride quality is also very good the suspension is nice and soft so bad patches broken roads marui knows exactly how they are in our country and the tuning is done in the same way despite the added weight and the added bit at the rear it still feels nice and soft and given the soft seats the overall Comfort is quite good and speaking of on the handling the steering is nice and light again nothing really sporty about it tight Corners you will have a fair bit of under steer if you push it but apart from that everyday maneuvering is very easy the steering feels fluid and consistent and tight turns are dealt with ease we couldn't do an efficiency test on a short drive but mati claims 24.7 kpl for the manual and 25.7 kpl for the AMT for those who want even more desire also gets the option of a CNG with the 5-speed manual gearbox which claims 33.7 km per kg the full test figures will be out as soon as we get our hands on the car for a longer [Music] duration prices for the desire start at 6.79 lak rupees and go till 10.14 lakh rupees for the top spec AMT variant the CG starts at 8.74 lak rupees for the vxi and 9.84 lakh for the ZXI trim with the manual gearbox this makes it competitive against his Rivals when it comes to manual versions but the most expensive in the segment with an AMT what maruti has done with the new desire is give it a new identity with new sharp looks added features bright upholstry and the extra practicality it has all the right ingredients to pull in the crowd and continue on as maruti's bestselling sedan [Music]",

        "transcript": "Should I go for a hatchback or a sedan? Let's find out. First, let's get this out of the way: both cars come with the same key, and the color is not even different. You get lock and unlock buttons on both. The only difference is that the Dzire's key has an additional button to open the boot, which, when pressed, not only unlocks the boot but opens it completely. However, if we just look at the keys, they are quite old-fashioned—small, lightweight plastic keys with a glossy finish on one side, and their design is quite basic.\n\nSpeaking of design, let's start with the Dzire. I find it to be decent, and then comes the Swift, whose design you might prefer more. Between the two, I think the Dzire looks better because its design is simpler and more subdued. It has more horizontal elements, and the headlamp is sleeker. The Swift looks more modern and larger, but most importantly, it now starts at ₹500,000, which is a bit of a budget concern. Now, which car do you prefer between the two? Let us know in the comments.\n\nNext up is boot space. Here, the Dzire is clearly better due to its body style. The Dzire's boot space is more generous, and the dashboard and doors have textured materials, while the steering wheel and center console feature a gloss black finish to show that this car is almost ₹1 million. The fit and finish are similar to what you'd expect from any other Maruti Suzuki. Just imagine if this black had red inserts; it would have looked much more appealing. Right now, it looks more sporty than premium, and if you want a sporty look for your car, one drawback is that the seats get dirty very quickly and require a lot of effort to keep clean.\n\nNow, there is a gray strip on the dashboard, but there is also a wooden finish included. Now, if you've spent ₹500,000 extra, you would expect a few more features, right? In the Dzire, you get two or three extra features: a single-pane sunroof, a tire pressure monitoring system, and a 360° camera. The sunroof isn't that useful; it depends on your preference, but the camera is definitely useful if you're trying to maneuver out of a tight parking space or a narrow lane. Other than that, the features are the same in both cars. You get a 9-inch touchscreen with a simple interface and large icons, making it easy for older family members to use. Both have a wireless Android Auto charger, adjustable power mirrors, auto AC, push-button start/stop, and auto headlamps.\n\nIn terms of safety, besides the 360° camera and tire pressure monitoring system, there are no changes. Both cars come with six standard airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, ISOFIX child seat anchors, and hill hold assist. The Swift doesn't have a camera, but it does come with a rearview camera with guidelines. One more thing: the Dzire has a five-star safety rating from Global NCAP, while Maruti's tests for Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP are not available, so we won't know until then.\n\nNext is practicality, and the tone will change here. Storage and charging options are almost the same in both cars. All four doors have 1-liter bottle holders, and the Swift has 500ml holders. You get two cup holders at the front, a glove box, and seat back pockets behind the front passenger seat in both cars. The Dzire has an additional rear seat center armrest with two cup holders. For charging, both cars have a wireless phone charger, a 12-volt socket, a USB port, and a Type-C port for rear passengers, along with rear AC vents.\n\nNow let's talk about space. Starting with the rear, it is sufficient for three, with good headroom, and there are no issues with knee room and foot room. The under-thigh support is also decent. The rear seat's recline angle is good, so you can sit comfortably on long rides. However, there is no center armrest, which would have obviously made the rear seat experience more comfortable. The dark theme of the cabin gives a cramped feeling, and the larger headrests reduce visibility. So, while space is sufficient for two people, the rear seat experience could have been better, as it is in the Dzire.\n\nHere, the space is similar, and despite the sloping roofline, headroom is sufficient. Yes, the Swift also accommodates taller individuals. Speaking of visibility, it is also better due to the cabin lights, which give a better sense of space, and the sunroof lets in more light, improving visibility.\n\nNow that we've covered the differences between these two cars, before moving to the verdict, let's look at their driving experience. Both cars have the same engine and transmission options, and their tuning is also the same, which is better for city drives. Both come with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder petrol engine, which feels slightly less powerful and not as refined as before, meaning you will feel some vibrations in the footwell while driving, but they are not enough to be irritating. Power delivery is smooth, and even though the power is less, city drives are significantly better, giving you an easy mileage of 17 to 18 km/l, and on the highway, around 20-21 km/l.\n\nThe Dzire comes with a manual transmission, and in first gear, the power feels a bit low, requiring you to stay on the clutch, but the tuning in second gear is quite good. It's so good that you can easily reach speeds of 80-85 km/h in this gear without straining the engine, making it easy to drive in the city without feeling a lack of power or needing to change gears frequently.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Swift. In the Swift, you will take time to reach high speeds, especially if you're accelerating from 70-80 km/h to 100 km/h; the acceleration feels slow, and you will have to plan your overtakes. Overall, you will feel a lack of power in the highway experience. Both cars have lost some of their sporty feel, but they have become better for city driving. So, I guess you have to lose something to gain something, but you won't lose comfort in either car. At city speeds, small potholes are easily absorbed, and you won't feel any sudden jerks inside the car. Yes, you will notice road cracks more, but it doesn't lead to discomfort. Rear seat passengers will also be comfortable in both cars. The cabin's movement is well controlled, and you won't feel any sudden body movements inside the car. However, on highways, both cars can be quite jumpy, and at high speeds, even small potholes will cause noticeable body movement. It's better to keep them slow on highway connections and flyover joints to avoid jolts, but rear passengers will face significant body movement.\n\nWhen it comes to handling, both cars feel planted in corners, making them fun to drive. But if I had to pick one, I would lean towards the Swift. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the Dzire easily justifies its ₹50,000 price premium due to its better cabin, additional features, and improved safety. Anyway, after financing, the monthly difference will only be ₹1,000. So, if you're looking for a complete family car in this budget, we recommend the Dzire. If you want the Swift, yes, the Dzire is definitely the better car overall, but whether its benefits are useful to you is something you'll have to decide. I hope you liked the video.

        "transcript": "[Music] Welcome to car and bike. I am Sean Vijay Ragun and this is the Maruti Suzuki Desire. It is one of the bestselling cars in India and it has been part of the car and bike garage for about 6 months now. It is now time for the car to head back to its home. But before that I wanted to share how is it to live with the desire which is also Bauti's top seller. Now there are some pros, there are some cons and a lot in between. So if you are new to the channel do subscribe to carbike and hit that bell notification as well so you never miss an update like this and videos that we make for you. Now the desire has been in the market for several years now and this particular car is the fourth generation avar of the subcompact sedan and compared to the first generation model the desire has come a long way. It now looks more proportionate welldesigned and well styled. You get a proper size. Now this is not a threebox sedan but you still have that look over here with a boot with a glass area and a proper bonnet but it also looks nice. Now you have LED lighting all across. You also get alloy wheels that look particularly nice in this dual tone avar. And it is well sized for the city. So it's easier to maneuver around in traffic and those small lanes we see in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. And also it is stable enough for the highways because I have taken this car from Mumbai to Goa and I had no issues in terms of its size and capabilities. But more on that when we are driving the car. But overall, I think that the Desire is well sized for a city car. Now, like the exterior, the cabin of the Desire 2 has evolved over the years, and I can say that right now, the Desire's cabin is probably one of its best so far. Now, here you get a lot of textures and design that it has a modern appeal to it. This 9-in touchscreen infotainment system adds a bit of uh futuristic look to the car. You also get automatic AC. So yes, feature- wise it is quite packed. But what it lacks is a sense of premiumness. You see that while the textures and the design are nice. The use of plastic quality, the PL the materials used here are not of the best quality. H they could have been better. Uh even this fourwood treatment is not the best. So it could have been something a bit more premium. Uh you also get these seats. Now I have a big problem with these seats. You can see that these are fabric seat covers. Uh Maruti could have gone with four leather for the top of the line at least. But yes, here even in this particular top end model you get fabric seats and these are quite uh white and they get dirty. You can see that this car is already dirty. Uh this is not something that happened by us. This was this came in this uh way. So yes uh it will quick get dirty quickly and you have to take that into account. Also an issue for me is the ergonomics of the car. You see that there is no central armrest for the driver and I feel it is a very important feature to have that adds a bit of comfort level that is missing in the desire. You get it in some of the big other Marikas like francs but here it is missing. While the seats do offer support cushioning could have been better. they are a bit on the thinner side and while it's good enough for everyday commute or short drives, long drives will be a challenge. My advice would be to get some nice quality aftermarket seat covers with some padding. Apart from that, the space is good. You can have uh four to five adults sitting here. Yes, the second row uh having three adults will be a tight squeeze, but it won't be very uncomfortable. It will be okay for short journeys, but for four adults, it is a nice car. It is spacious enough and no wonder the desire has been a big choice for Indian buyers who are looking for a family sedan. [Music] Now with this fourth generation Desire, you get a lot of features that were never offered with this car before and some of these features are something that you did not expect that Maroti will offer with the Desire. This includes a big 9-in touchscreen infotainment system. You get uh both wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and the connection is also quite seamless. Uh you also get a wireless phone charger now so you can charge your phone without the cables. There is a sunroof as well. This is an electric single pens unit but for the size of the car this is quite ideal. Then you have a 360deree view camera which I feel is a very important feature and especially for a city car which is a city family car uh considering uh we have narrow roads and small parking spots in cities like Mumbai uh it comes in great help and uh it is a good feature. In fact the quality of the 360° view camera of the desire is also quite nice. These are features that elevate the Desire's appeal. And if you can look past some of the negatives of the cabin like the quality of plastics and the seat covers, then the Desire is a very nice car to have. The Desire has managed to put the stereotype to rest that Maruti Suzuki cars are not safe because they get low safety ratings. The car has bagged five-star rating both from Global Encap as well as Bhat Ncap. Being the first Maruti Suzuki car to do that. Every trim gets six airbags, electronic stability control, seat belt, pre-tensioners and ISOIX mounts. So yes, if safety rating is important to you, the Desire safety package brings real peace of mind. Now, there are a lot of things to love about the Desire, especially when you're driving it, but uh I have to say that this engine might not be one of them for me especially. Well, you see, it produces almost the same amount of power and torque as the previous generation model which came with a four-cylinder engine whereas this is a three port engine. It's a new engine. Yes. Uh and it produces almost the same amount of power and output. Uh but uh it is not as refined as the previous motor. It is also not as peppy. Well uh this engine works nicely in the Swift which is a smaller car. Uh but in the desire it feels sluggish. It feels a bit underpowered and not that uh fun to drive in essence. So yes, it will do the job but it is nothing that will make you want to get behind the wheel again and again. I like the car's ride quality. It feels supple. It It takes on all the undulations on the road quite nicely and also it handles really well. Uh it is nimble so easy to maneuver around the city and uh that will not be an issue. The steering is light. Yes, a bit too light for my liking but great if you are driving in uh stop and go traffic and you you encounter traffic on a day-to-day basis then this is a boon for you. Now the desire comes in both manual as well as AMT option and owing to the nature of the engine. I feel that uh I prefer the manual version more because there I have more control. I can engage with the car more and uh that adds a bit of uh driving pleasure for me. However, if you want something more smoother uh in terms of drivability, you want something that is hassle-free, then the AMT option makes a lot of sense. And uh if that is something that you want from your drive then you should go for it. In terms of fuel efficiency, Maruti Suzuki claims that the desire can return a little over 25 km to the litter both in the manual as well as the AMT. Uh yes, in a real perfect scenario where you get the ideal driving conditions, you can achieve somewhere around that. But uh on an average, realistically speaking, the Desire will offer you a mileage of anywhere between 18 to 20 km to the litter on the highway. And in the city, you can possibly go down as low as 15 to 17 km to the litter. And those are very good numbers. And uh I'll tell you that uh I drove this car down from Mumbai to Goa and I did about 530 or 540 odd kilometers one way and I did it in one single tank and that is saying something. The Maruti Suzuki Desire is offered in four key variants LXI, VXI, ZXI and ZXI Plus. And depending on the trim, transmission, and fuel option, you have nine different choices, including a factory fitted CNG option, which is available in two variants. [Applause] Now, after spending 6 months with the Desire, I can say that the Desire is not about thrills. It is about reliability. It is about frugality and it is about ease of use. Now it is a practical car through and through and with all the features and tech on offer that Maruti is offering with this fourth gener it will also attract the modern-day car buyer. Now there are some negatives as well like uh the quality of plastics and the seating material is average and the engine is a bit underwhelming but you also have to think about the fact that the engine is also very frugal. So though overall the desire is not that expensive. So, it is affordable to buy. It will not be heavy on your pocket to maintain. And the fuel efficiency is something that you can live with in this modern-day fuel prices. Overall, it is a great pick for the firsttime car buyer or budget conscious families. So, what do you think about the Desire? Let us know in the comments. If you have any questions or queries about the car, you mention them in the comments and we will try to answer them. And if you like this video, do give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. And for more such videos, keep following carbike.",

        "transcript": "You truly get to know them once you start living with them. No, no, wait. This is not about humans, but cars. I've been living with a particular car for over 3 months now. A car which has become a household name by now. A brand in itself. And I'm talking about the allnew Marauti Suzuki Desire. [Music] The Desire's top-of-the-line ZXI Plus and the AMT guys came to the car wireless table in late December and I have been daily driving it since then. With over 5,000 km already clocked on the auto, I have plenty of things to talk about. The good, the not so good, the features that make sense, sensible features which have given a miss, the real world fuel efficiency figures, and the most important thing, can you actually live with one? Well, I'll try to cover everything. So stick around till the end. My name is and you are watching Car Walle. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Choosing the right variant is quite easy as there are not a lot of them. That's just four LXI, VXI, ZXI, and ZXI Plus. This one we have here is a topsp spec ZXI plus in petrol AMT guys. I am specifying petrol because the CG option 2 with the VXI and ZXI variants. Now, as for the prices, the desire continues to be in the affordable price bracket. Currently, the compact sedan is available at a starting extra room cost of rupes 6.84 lakh. Meanwhile, the one right here will cost you rupes 10.20 lakh without the taxes. [Music] So without wasting any more time, let's quickly get to the positives and see what makes the new gen Maruti Suzuki Desire a compelling option. The Desire has always been the car for the masses. I mean the brand has never focused on the features at least with this one, but that has definitely changed with the new gen. This one is loaded and how I mean there's a lot of mouthy bits here from the swift breza and even the baleno. Well, it gets a 9-in infotainment screen which runs on a very simple yet very functional UI. I mean there's wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity and it connects instantly the moment you get in the wireless Apple CarPlay just connects automatically and the maps are displayed very in a very detailed manner. Also, one thing is also interesting. You can uh see the real world or the onboard navigation in the mid screen using the Apple maps on, of course, the Apple CarPlay. However, there's one thing that I don't like about the infotainment is the bezel around it. I mean, it could have been a lot slimmer because that doesn't add any purpose. It's just massive and a chunky piece of plastic. When you are driving, you look at it. Other than that, there are other features like this 360° camera. There's electric sunroof, the three-point seat belt, high adjustable driver seat. Also, there's a wireless charger and thankfully you can also turn it off, which is a good thing because it charges your phone very slow and the phone heats up. I personally don't use it, but again, having an option is a very good thing. Well, this is an important one. After constantly facing backlash for the safety aspect, Marauti has finally changed how their cars is seen. Well, this one right here is a five-star GNC cap rated car, and it has a lot of safety features going for it. ABS with DVD, brake assist, hill hold control, 360° camera, six airbags, and most importantly, seat belt reminder with a warning, but with load sensors, and in a big safety update, the new Desire has now also proudly received a five-star safety rating from Bharat Ncap, building on its five-star global endcap success. [Music] Another positive aspect is the new Z series engine. Yes, it lacks a cylinder, but hear me out. It gets a 1.2 L N petrol engine paired with AMT gearbox and a 5-speed manual gearbox. In this combination, the AMT version, it is a perfect balance between the performance and efficiency, and the engine really feels good. While this motor is tuned to generate 80 bhp and 111 mm of peak torque. Now, this new Z series engine feels smooth and refined, and it is quite zesty for most of the part. Not as not quick right off the bat, but once you hit the sweet spot of 2,00 to 2,500 RPM, it is it feels lively. The acceleration is smooth. The gearbox, the AMD gearbox feels perfectly balanced, and it doesn't feel jerky at all. I mean, the gear shifts are not exactly unnoticeable, but it is not unpleasant as well. Apart from that, the sharing is lightweight. The controls are easy. The overall lightweight nature of the car itself make it quite easy to maneuver. For example, this turn here is going to be extremely easy. So from lock to lock, it is 3.5 turns. Apart from that, the ride quality is pleasant. I mean the suspension is slight perfectly tuned. Uh now it shares a platform with the Swift which is slightly which has slightly stiffer suspension. This one has a very comfortable ride quality. The suspensions are tuned it to be for a family car unlike Swift. It feels much more tighter compared to this. Other than that the overall ride quality is good for the front seats and for the back seats. Now coming to the visibility part, the pillars are marginally thin and the glass area, the window area is good. The overall visibility be from the IRVM, the OVMs are pretty big and it's quite easy to look out for obstacles and overall the vision is great with this car. That said, the braking could have been better. I mean it is progressive though but there's no rear disc brakes so that could have been better. Also with the 163 mm ground clearance I never faced any issue over the 3 months I have been using this. There's no potholes or road andulation that you know felt inside the cabin due to sharp nature. Also the NVH could have been better. I mean this is a con which I'll talk about later. But yeah, the NVS the engine current is it filters inside the cabin insulation is something which Mari could have worked on with this one. Again, this could be a characteristic of a three-cylinder engine compared to a four-cylinder one. The vibrations could be felt at the pedal and the steering wheel also on the gear knob, but again, not something very unpleasant. And for the final segment of positives, we have kept of course the mileage figures, the real world mileage figures of the Marauti Suzuki Desire. We did an extensive caral style mileage test of the Marauti Suzuki Desire and the figures are rather good. So talking about the mileage, we did real world mileage test and in our results in city, the car returned 14.1 km per liter. Meanwhile on highway, the number went up to 19.42 km per liter. This being an AMT version, of course, the manual maybe would give better efficiency depending on your driving style. However, in my daily commute, I've been extracting 16 to 17 km per liter on an average in scenarios including highway and city as well. So, overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the mileage of the new gen Desire. Now that we are done with the positives, let's quickly glance over the underwhelming aspects of the Marauti Suzuki Desire. Now, don't get me wrong, the Desire gets plenty of handful features, but there are a few features it still lacks which could have made more sense. Firstly, these seats are fabric white upholstery and they get dirty easily and it is equally hard to keep them clean. Also, the front seats are not ventilated. then the driver doesn't get an amish at all even though this is the top-of-the-line ZXI plus AMT version. So that could have been a boon to drivers. And finally, this is sort of nitpicking, but an auto dimming IRVM would have made more sense, but this is again a manual IRVM day and night. The NVH and overall cabin insulation could have been better. I mean the plastic quality or rather the material quality again is slightly underwhelming compared to its major rival the Honda Amaze which gets slightly better material quality. About that we have done an extensive comparison between the Honda Amaze and the Maroti Suzuki Desire. So head to our channel to watch that video. [Music] Well, there's a very subtle way for me to conclude what I feel about the new Maruti Suzuki Desire. I mean, the name plate itself is enough for it to continue selling like a hot cake. And with the latest update, it is much more easier for me to recommend it to more customers. There's hardly anything that I hate about it. I mean, look at it. It is a well sorted, nononsense car for a family of four who's looking for a car option to buy with a low service cost, hassle-free ownership experience, reliability, and also good fuel efficiency. I mean, Maruti has just got the recipe right. I personally enjoyed spending most of my time with this one for over past few months now. Be the daily commute of over 50 kilometers, weekend getaways with friends. Hell, I've also used it to move my house around. So indeed, it has kept me happy for the last few months and I think there's no incident that has made me question its reliability. So that's it. This was the video guys. I mean if you have any question related to the Marauti Suzuki Desire or any other car, the comment sections is open. My name is and you are watching Carwali. [Music]",

        "transcript": "I have had this Dzire for the last 6 months, and here are three things I really like about it and three things I don’t. The design of the Dzire has evolved over the last four generations. It looks more proportionate, stylish, and comes with a lot of fancy features. For instance, you get LED lighting, LED DRLs, LED tail lamps, and sporty dual-tone alloys. The new Dzire is quite feature-packed. According to modern car standards, it comes with a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a wireless phone charger, a 360° view camera, and even a sunroof. The Dzire is thoroughly a practical car. It's affordable, easy to maintain, and very fuel-efficient. In fact, the company claims that whether it's the manual or AMT variant, you can achieve a mileage of 25 kmpl with this car. During my testing, I noticed that in the city, it comfortably delivers an average of 16 to 18 kmpl, and on the highway, it can realistically give you 20 kmpl or more.\n\nNow, talking about the negatives, I have a slight issue with the fit and finish of the Dzire. The styling is quite good, with nice textures and paneling, but the quality of the plastic used is not top-notch. It feels a bit average. Even in the top-end variant, you will find fabric seats, which are also in a light color. There are no options for darker colors, so they will stain quite quickly. I also have some problems with the ergonomics of the Dzire. There is no central armrest, so there is no space to rest your arm, and I think this is an important feature. On long drives, this can induce fatigue. It was quite important to have that here. I also didn’t find the seating position very comfortable. I am 5 feet 9 inches tall, and finding a perfect ideal seating position according to my size and stretch is a bit challenging. I have noticed that I experience some pain in my upper shoulder during long drives, so getting the perfect seating position is somewhat difficult.\n\nThe Dzire comes with a 1.2 L petrol engine. It is a three-cylinder motor. Previously, you had a four-cylinder motor, which felt more refined, smoother, and peppier. Here, while the Dzire's engine gives similar output, it feels sluggish, which I didn’t like much. Finally, there is a stigma that the Dzire is a taxi, but with this new generation model, the company has included many modern features that make it feel like a modern-day car. However, the company had stated at the launch that this new generation Dzire would not be offered for the taxi segment. Yet, within a few months of the launch, you might have seen this new Dzire in taxis as well. So, this might not sit well with some buyers.",
